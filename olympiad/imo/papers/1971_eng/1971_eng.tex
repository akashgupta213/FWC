\section* {1971/1.}

Prove that the following assertion is true for $n=3$ and $n=5$, and that it is false for every other natural number $n > 2$: \\
If $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are arbitrary real numbers, then
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
$
\begin{aligned}
(a_1-a_2)(a_1-a_3)...(a_1-a_n)
+(a_2-a_1)(a_2-a_3)...(a_2-a_n)\\
+...
+(a_n-a_1)(a_n-a_2)...(a_n-a_{n-1}) \ge  0
\end{aligned}
$
\end{enumerate}

\section* {1971/2.}
Consider a convex polyhedron $P_1$ with nine vertices $A_1,A_2,....,A_9$; let $P_i$ be the polyhedron obtaianed $P_i$ by a translation that moves vertex $A_1$ to
$A_i(i = 2, 3, ..., 9)$. Prove that at least two of the polyhedra $P_1, P_2, ..., P_9$ have
an interior point in common.

\section* {1971/3.}
Prove that the set of integers of the form $2^k-3(k=2,3,....)$ contains an infinite subset in which every two members are relatively prime.

\section* {1971/4.}
All the faces of tetrahedron $ABCD$ are acute-angled triangles.
We consider all closed polygonal paths of the form $XYZX$ defined as follows:
$X$ is a point on edge $AB$, distinct from $A$ and $B$; similarly $Y,Z$ are interior points of edges $BC,CD$ Prove :

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\angle DAB +\angle BCD \ne \angle CDA +\angle ABC$, then among the polygonal paths there is none of minimal lenght.
\item If $\angle DAB+\angle BCD = \angle CDA + \angle ABC$, then there are infinitely many shortest polygonal paths,
there is none of minimal length.
\item $
\angle DAB + \angle BCD = \angle CDA + \angle ABC$, then there are infinitely many
shortest polygonal paths, their common length being $2ACsin(\alpha/2)$, where $\alpha = \angle BAC + \angle CAD + \angle DAB$
\end{enumerate}

\section* {1971/5.}
Prove that for every natural number $m$, there exists a finite set $S$ of points in a plane with the following property
For every point $A$ in $S$, there are exactly $m$ points in $S$ which are at unit distance from $A$.

\section*{1971/6.}

Let $A=(a_{ij})$, $i,j=1,2,\ldots,n$ be a square matrix whose elements are non-negative integers. 
Suppose that whenever an element $a_{ij}=0$, the sum of the elements in the $i$th row and the $j$th column is $\ge {n^2}{2}$.
